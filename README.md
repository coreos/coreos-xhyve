# CoreOS _over_ OSX made simple
###### built on top of [xhyve](https://github.com/mist64/xhyve)'s _golang_ [bindings](https://github.com/hooklift/xhyve)

**CAVEATS**
-----------

 > - `xhyve`, on top of we built, is a young project, so expect bugs!
 > - You must be running OS X Yosemite, 10.10.3, or later on a 2010,
 >   or later, Mac (i.e. one with a CPU that supports EPT) for things to work.
 > - if you use **any** version of VirtualBox prior to VirtualBox 4.3.30 then
 >   `xhyve` will crash your system either if VirtualBox is running, or had been
 >   run previously after the last reboot (see `xhyve`'s issues
 >   [#5](https://github.com/mist64/xhyve/issues/5) and
 >   [#9](https://github.com/mist64/xhyve/issues/9) for the full context). So,
 >   if you are unable to update VirtualBox to the latest, either of the 4.x or
 >   5.x streams, and were using it in your current session please do restart
 >   your Mac before attempting to run `corectl`.


## Step by Step Instructions

### Install `corectl`
```
❯❯❯ git clone git@github.com:TheNewNormal/corectl.git
❯❯❯ cd corectl
❯❯❯ make
```
### kickstart a CoreOS VM
the following command will fetch the `latest` CoreOS Alpha image
available, verify it with the build public key, add an OEM `xhyve`
personality and then load it over `xhyve`.

```
❯❯❯ sudo corectl run

```

In your terminal you should see something along this:

```
(...)
This is localhost (Linux x86_64 4.1.5-coreos) 13:23:20
SSH host key: d0:b7:8e:5a:ef:c3:ef:f5:4d:69:c0:ba:35:62:28:3c (DSA)
SSH host key: 2d:11:6f:7c:84:f7:36:34:e7:b9:a8:73:f9:1d:ae:72 (ED25519)
SSH host key: 31:02:9b:95:99:60:d8:5f:74:36:44:30:be:aa:65:ef (RSA)
eth0: 192.168.64.220 fe80::7817:77ff:fe6f:cf32

localhost login: core (automatic login)

CoreOS stable (779.0.0)
Update Strategy: No Reboots
Last login: Tue Aug 25 13:23:20 +0000 2015 on /dev/tty1.
core@localhost ~ $
```
you 'll find out that `/Users` is available (via NFS) already inside your VM.
that will come handy when you come to play with `docker` volumes later...

### Usage
```
CoreOS over OSX made simple.
❯❯❯ http://github.com/TheNewNormal/corectl


Usage:
  corectl [flags]
  corectl [command]

Available Commands:
  rm          Removes one or more CoreOS images from local fs
  kill        Halts one or more running CoreOS instances
  ls          Lists locally available CoreOS images
  load        Loads from an instrumentation file (in TOML, JSON or YAML) one or more CoreOS instances
  version     Shows corectl version information
  ps          Lists running CoreOS instances
  pull        Pulls a CoreOS image from upstream
  run         Starts a new CoreOS instance
  ssh         Attach to or run commands inside a running CoreOS instance

Flags:
      --debug[=false]: adds extra verbosity, and options, for debugging purposes and/or power users

Use "corectl [command] --help" for more information about a command.

All flags can also be configured via upper-case environment variables prefixed with "COREOS_"
For example, "--debug" => "COREOS_DEBUG"

### simple usage recipe: a docker and rkt playground
- create a volume to store your persistent data. (will be
  `/var/lib/{docker|rkt}`)
  ```
  ❯❯❯ dd if=/dev/zero of=var_lib_docker.img  bs=1G count=16
  ```
  in this case we created it with 16GB.

- *format* it
  > requires [homebrew's](http://brew.sh) e2fsprogs package installed.
  >
  > `❯❯❯ brew install e2fsprogs`

  ```
  ❯❯❯ /usr/local/Cellar/e2fsprogs/1.42.12/sbin/mke2fs  -t ext4 -m0 -F var_lib_docker.img
  ```

- *label* it
  ```
  ❯❯❯ /usr/local/Cellar/e2fsprogs/1.42.12/sbin/e2label var_lib_docker.img rkthdd
  ```
  here, we labeled our volume `rkthdd` which is the *signature* that our
  [*recipe*](cloud-init/docker-only-with-persistent-storage.txt) expects.

  >by relying in *labels* for volume identification we get around the issues we'd
  >have otherwise if we were depending on the actual volume name (/dev/vd...) as
  >those would have to be hardcoded (an issue, if one is mix and matching
  >multiple recipes all dealing with different volumes...)

- start your `docker` and `rkt` playground.
  ```
  ❯❯❯ sudo UUID=deadbeef-dead-dead-dead-deaddeafbeef \
    ./corectl run --volume absolute_or_relative_path/to/persistent.img \
    --cloud_config cloud-init/docker-only-with-persistent-storage.txt \
    --cpus 2 --memory 2048 --name containerland -d
  ```
 this will start a VM named `containerland` in the background (`-d`) with the
 volume we created previously feeded, 2 virtual cores and 2GB of RAM. The
 provided [cloud-config](cloud-init/docker-only-with-persistent-storage.txt)
 will format the given volume (if it wasn't yet) and bind mount both
 ``/var/lib/rkt` and `/var/lib/docker` on top of it. docker will also become
 available through socket activation. above we passed arguments to the VM both
 via environment variables and command flags. both ways work, just use whatever
 suits your taste best.

 > Regarding `docker`, CoreOS shipped the 1.7 stream in all releases older than
 > the 801.0.0 one. So, if you plan to run any of these releases, in order
 > to talk to CoreOS' docker daemon you'll need on your Mac a matching docker
 client,as Homebrew is already defaulting on docker 1.8.x...
 > ```
 > ❯❯❯ brew remove docker
 > ❯❯❯ brew tap homebrew/versions
 > ❯❯❯ brew install docker171
 > ```

- now, from another *shell* in your mac...

  ```
  ❯❯❯ ./corectl ps
